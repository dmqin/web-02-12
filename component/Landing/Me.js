                        I have been learning about full-stack web (full stack is a myth btw) since the beginning of 2021 and I learn this because I have an interest in technology. But, I only code in my leisure time. </p>
                        <p className="text-lg mt-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                        Actually, this is my own project, not for work or study, just for fun. 
                        I made this website use javascript language with Next Js library and Tailwind CSS framework. 
                        This website has not finished yet because it only shows the frontend or we can say the design. 
                        As a result, some of the buttons can not be used for now and I will add more backend features as soon as possible. 
                        Last but not the least, I wanna say thank you to everyone who already read until here and I hope u guys enjoy this website. 
                        That's all I can say and stay tuned :)
                        </p>
