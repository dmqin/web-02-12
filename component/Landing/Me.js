      I live in Surakarta, a small city which is located in Central Java, Indonesia. I have been learning about full stack web since the beginning of 2021 but, i only code in my leisure time because despite of
      learning how to code I'm also a student and I have a plan to continue my study in computer science major next year.</p>

                          Actually this is my own project, not for work nor study, just for fun. I made this website use javascript language with <a > Next Js </a> library and <a>Tailwind </a> CSS framework. I use NEXT JS because It has all the 
                          functionality you need to create a ready-to-go application. Plus, the documentation is great, and it's getting more and more popular with front-end developers. Not only that, I also have a plan to add more 
                          features on this website using database function and simple mini-games such as rock, paper, scissors! That's all I can say and stay tuned  :)
