                        I have been learning about full-stack web (full stack is a myth btw) since the beginning of 2021 and I learn this because I have an interest in technology. But, I only code in my leisure time. </p>

                          Actually this is my own project, not for work nor study, just for fun. I made this website use javascript language with <a > Next Js </a> library and <a>Tailwind </a> CSS framework. I use NEXT JS because It has all the 
                          functionality you need to create a ready-to-go application. Plus, the documentation is great. Not only that, I also have a plan to add more 
                          features on this website using database function and simple mini-games such as rock, paper, scissors! Last but not the least, I wanna say thank you too everyone who already read until here and I hope u guys enjoy this website.
                           That's all I can say and stay tuned  :)
