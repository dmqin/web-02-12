      <p class="md:text-lg text-gray-900 text-justify"> Welcome to my first website ! Hey guys my name is Desta, you also can call me Dimqin. I currently 16 years old and I will be 17 this December. 
      I live in Surakarta, a small city which is located in Central Java, Indonesia. I have been learning about full stack web since the beginning of 2021 but, i only code in my leisure time because despite of
      learning how to code I'm also a student and I have a plan to continue my study in computer science major next year.
      That's all I can say about me, I hope you guys enjoy my website :)</p>
